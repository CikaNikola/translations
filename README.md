# Overview
This Github repository is for the crowd-sourcing of translations for multi-language support in [indieVelo](https://indievelo.com).

Contributions are warmly welcomed from the entire community - both for corrections and improvements to existing translations, and for the addition of new languages.

Please feel free to join the [indieVelo Discord](https://discord.gg/nY5u74u7Ak) to chat and share any thoughts, ideas or suggestions on translations (or anything else!). 

# Current Languages

* da-DK : Danish
* de-DE : German

* fr-FR : French
* it-IT : Italian
* nl-NL : Dutch
* pl-PL : Polish

Any other translations however would also be very gratefully received!

# How-To
To make a contribution:

1. Create you own free personal account on GitHub.
   
2. Fork this repository.
   * This creates your own private copy of the files to edit.
   * Click the "Fork" button towards the top right hand corner of this page.

4. Edit any files as needed.
   * Select the files, then click on the pencil icon to edit.
   * If you are updating someone else's translation for anything other than obvious typos, please chat about it first on the indieVelo Discord.
   * Please note that the "en-GB" file is the primary translation and should not be edited (unless you spot a typo!).  Any translations into other languages should use this as the reference point for the meaning and intent for each phrase.  If adding a new language, take a copy of the contents of the "en-GB" file, rename it to the new language and then edit the new file directly.

5. Commit the update.
   * This only changes your own private copy of the files, not the main copies stored here.
   * Click on the "Commit Update" button that appears after you edit the file.
   * Note that you can make multiple edits and multiple commits before actually submitting any changes as below.
     
6. Create a pull request.
   * This submits all the changes to your private copy of the files for review into the main indieVelo code.
   * Click on the "Pull Request" button towards the top left hand corner of the page.
   * Then click on the "New Pull Request" button towards the top right hand corner of the page.
   * The click on the "Create Pull Request" button towards the top left hand corner of the page.
   * If this is your first edit, please do add your real name to the comments so that you can be credited properly within the indieVelo application.
   * Finally, click on the new "Create Pull Request" button towards the bottom of the area where you can add any comments.
     
8. Wait for it to be approved.
   * Once approved, changes will be made live to indieVelo almost instantly, without the need to wait for a new release.
